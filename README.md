Ruby code for calculating interesting numbers and math sequences

My name is Ken, I am a Software Developer interested in various mathematical sequences and numbers, and exploring Ruby. Many of the programs here were inspired by the Numberphile channel on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/user/numberphile). For the most part they are simple programs using brute force methods for calculations. As I learn more about Ruby, more sophisticated methods will be incorperated.

I'm am currently testing these on Ruby 2.2.5, however they will likely run on most versions of Ruby. These can be run in PowerShell on Windows or CLI on Linux/Unix by calling ruby and the program name:

Example:

\> ruby prime.rb

The programs will have a simple prompt asking for the highest number to calculate to. I have not yet included any error checking so stick to integers less than 1,000,000. There are some programs where calculations up to 1,000,000 will take up a good amount of time even on powerful computers. If you find yourself stuck running a program, ctrl-c will interupt and stop the program from running.

The results of the program will be posted within the console as well as written to a .txt file corresponding to the program name.
